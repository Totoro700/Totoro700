Hello! Welcome to my profile!ðŸŽ‰ Good to see you here!

I mainly like to program in Python and C++.

---

Somethings about me:
  - The first language I learned was [Python](https://python.org)
  - My favorite application ever made is cmd
  - I got attacked by a computer virus 14 times
  - I'm the worst at drawing, that is why you don't see a lot of logos or images in my [projects](https://github.com/Totoro700?tab=repositories)
  - I get easily bored
  - The most characters I typed in a [single file](https://github.com/Totoro700/PyTerm/blob/master/src/__main__.py) is 26,298 (Python)
  - I like to make my program messy
  - I really like to contribute to random repositories in GitHub
  - I like to use dark mode
